The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the department Id.

``` 
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
```


The Department table holds all departments of the company.

```
+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
```

Write a SQL query to find employees who earn the top three salaries in each of the department. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).

```+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+

```



Explanation: In IT department, Max earns the highest salary, both Randy and Joe earn the second highest salary, and Will earns the third highest salary. There are only two employees in the Sales department, Henry earns the highest salary while Sam earns the second highest salary.



个人觉得刷SQL题，能不用函数就不要用函数，基本的语法明明能做的。对于这种分组内取前几名的问题，可以先group by然后用having count()来筛选，比如这题，找每个部门的工资前三名，那么先在子查询中用Employee和自己做连接，连接条件是【部门相同但是工资比我高】，那么接下来按照having count(distinct Salary) <= 2来筛选的原理是：如果【跟我一个部门而且工资比我高的人数】不超过2个，那么我一定是部门工资前三，这样内层查询可以查询出所有符合要求的员工ID，接下来外层查询就简单了。 distinct 是因为如果部门里有几个工资一样的且都属于前三，那么都要包括

```mysql
select d.name as Department, e.name as Employee, e.salary 

from Employee e

join Department d

on e.DepartmentId = d.id

where e.id in 

(

  select e1.id

  from Employee e1

  left join Employee e2

  on e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId

  and e1.salary < e2.salary

  group by e1.id

  having count(distinct e2.Salary) <= 2

)
```
